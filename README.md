# Multi-Material Microfluidic Cartridge 
 
Design Approach
The design of the microfluidic cartridge focuses on the efficient storage and dispensing of multiple dry powders and viscous fluids without intermixing. The primary considerations for this design are functionality, ease of use, material compatibility, and manufacturability within micro-sized to mini-sized constraints.


Chamber Separation Mechanism
The cartridge incorporates separate chambers for each powder and fluid, ensuring no cross-contamination. The separation is achieved through:
Microfluidic Channels with Valves: These channels direct the flow of fluids and powders, with valves controlling the release from each chamber.
Membranes: Thin, flexible membranes act as barriers between different materials, preventing mixing while allowing controlled dispensing.
Pistons: Mechanically operated pistons help in dispensing the contents of each chamber accurately.


Assumptions
Powder Properties: Powders are assumed to be dry and free-flowing, with particle sizes small enough to pass through microfluidic channels.
Fluid Properties: Fluids range from medium to high viscosity (e.g., syrup, honey), and the materials used in the cartridge are non-reactive and compatible with these fluids.
Material Compatibility: The cartridge materials (likely polymers or silicone) are chosen for their non-reactive properties and compatibility with both powders and fluids.
Additional Considerations
Ease of Use: The design ensures user-friendly loading and dispensing. The chambers are easily accessible for refilling, and the dispensing mechanism is intuitive and straightforward.
Manufacturability: The dimensions and design elements are compatible with common 3D printing and micromachining techniques, ensuring that the cartridge can be manufactured efficiently.
Innovative Features: Unique aspects of the design include labeled annotations on the 3D model for key components, enhancing understanding and usability.
